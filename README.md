# Home Row Control

If you use a shortcut keys with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> often, you can create a more ergonomic layout by using <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd>, two big keys in the home row, as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> modifiers.

You need not give up on the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key behavior you are used to: it will act as usual when you strike it a single time, or like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> when held down as a modifier for other keys.
